        <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>These ground beef stroganoff noodles are a shortcut version of classic beef stroganoff in a one-pan version. The ultimate comfort food with flavorful ground beef, mushrooms, and egg noodles.<br>Like most people who grew up during the Golden Age of processed food, my mom bought a fair amount of pre-packaged, pre-mixed, just-add-water type meals, but when it came to pasta or noodles in a ground meat sauce, her hamburger did not need any help.</p> &nbsp;
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes</li>
                <li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds. Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</li>
            </ol>
